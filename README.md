Requirements
------------
To develop and run the application locally you will need to use Mac OSX or 
Linux and install the following:

+ **VirtualBox:** https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
+ **Vagrant:** https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
+ **Fabric:** http://www.fabfile.org/installing.html

It is likely that you already have Python, which Fabric requires. If you are 
unsure, open Terminal and execute `python`.
